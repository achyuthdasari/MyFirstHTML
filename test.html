<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar was born on 24 April 1973 is a former Indian international cricketer who was also the captain of the Indian national team. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen in the history of cricket.[5] He is the highest run scorer of all time in International cricket.
 Considered as the world's most prolific batsman of all time,[6] he is the only player to have scored one hundred international centuries, the first batsman to score a double century in a One Day International (ODI), the holder of the record for the most runs in both Test and ODI cricket, and the only player to complete more than 30,000 runs in international cricket.[7]

<h2 id="Fan Following" style="color:orange">Fan Following</h2> 
<p>Tendulkar's consistent performances earned him a fan following across the globe, including amongst Australian crowds, where Tendulkar has consistently scored centuries.
 One of the most popular sayings by his fans is "Cricket is my religion and Sachin is my God".[311] Cricinfo mentions in his profile that "... Tendulkar remains, by a distance, the most worshipped cricketer in the world."</p>
<p>During the Australian tour of India in 1998 Matthew Hayden said "I have seen God. He bats at no. 4 in India in Tests." However, on God, Tendulkar himself is reported to have said "I am not God of cricket.
 I make mistakes, God doesn't." Tendulkar made a special appearance in the Bollywood film Stumped in 2003, appearing as himself.</p>
<p>On 24 February 2010, Cricinfo site could not handle the heavy traffic experienced after Tendulkar broke the record for the highest individual male score in a One Day International match against South Africa, 
also becoming the first player to score 200* in the history of ODIs as more than 5 million fans visited the website at a time.</p>
<p>There have been many instances when Tendulkar's fans have undertaken extreme activities over his dismissal in the game. As reported by many Indian newspapers, a person hanged himself due to distress over Tendulkar's failure to reach his 100th century.</p>
<p>At home in Mumbai, Tendulkar's fan following has caused him to lead a different lifestyle. Ian Chappell has said that he would be unable to cope with the lifestyle Tendulkar was forced to lead, 
having to "wear a wig and go out and watch a movie only at night".[306] In an interview with Tim Sheridan, Tendulkar admitted that he sometimes went for quiet drives in the streets of Mumbai late at night when he would be able to enjoy some peace and silence. 
Tendulkar has a presence in the popular social networking site Twitter with the user name sachin_rt, since May 2010.</p>
